# ShikiJoyExt
Chrome extension that changes [animejoy.ru](https://animejoy.ru) page content to my React app

## Reasoning
- AnimeJoy is a nice site, but user experience is not great.
- I want to integrate [Shikimori](https://shikimori.one).
- Absence of API and Cloudflare protection makes it very problematic to build a separate website.

#### Notes
This is a development repo. Releases will be available later.

Run `cd react` and `npm install` to install dependencies. Then you can run 
* `npm run build` to generate bundled script and stylesheet.
* `npm run dev` to run demo on your machine.
